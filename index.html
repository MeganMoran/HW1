		<h1>About Megan</h1>
		<p>
		I grew up in the northwest suburbs of Chicago. My high school was very large with over, 6000 students. I am a 20 year old student in my third year of college at The University of Iowa.
		I am a Management Information Systems Major, who dreams of becoming a website developer and designer. I have only lived in Illinois and Iowa (now for college). I also have yet to leave the country.
		I have been a golf caddy, veterinarian's assistant, a clothing store associate and cashier, a camp counselor, a teachers' assistant, an office assistant, an intern for a job placement agency, and a website quality assurance employee for a software company. 
		This summer I will be working as a systems analyst for State Farm and am extremely excited for the new experience.
		</p>

		<p>
		I have always enjoyed sports and was most competitive with field hockey and softball. I recieved the All-State award in Illinois for field hockey. I also went to nationals with my travel softball team in high school.
		Currently, I am on The University of Iowa club field hockey team. I am training for a 5k in the summer, hoping to maintain a 7 minute per mile average through out the race. I also am training for a 35 mile bike race in the summer
		supporting Multiple Sclerosis. Since I like staying active I am taking a badminton, rock climbing, and mountain biking class.
